Test suite for Enhanced Integration (EI) features.

Tests the enhanced functionality that builds on Foundation Improvements:
- EI-01: Query-Adaptive Enhanced Retriever
- EI-02: Enhanced Coverage with Increased K-Values
- EI-03: Smart Chat History with Semantic Topic Detection
- EI-04: Enhanced Retrieval Debug System
- EI-05: Person Context Enhancement

These tests validate production functionality without mocking core components.
